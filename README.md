# Statistical-Analysis-on-Survey-about-sleep-habits
we conducted a survey about sleep habits among people and their habits before sleeping ,demographic data, data about health...,etc <br/>and we did some statistical tests ,model validation , pre-test,<i>internal consistency<i/> <br/>
# Data collection
we collected responses from people through <b>Google forms<b/> 
# REQUIRMENTS
knowledge about :<br/>
-Data preprocessing & Cleaning 
-Statistical  Background [inferential & descriptive]
-Hypothesis test
-clustring techniques
-construct validity 
-internal consistency and Reliability

# PREPROCESSING Stage
1- rename the features of data as it was quesions
2- handle null values wrong responses
3- put constrains on the age of the response and drop who is out of the constrain ( who is under 18 years old )
4- mapping & transform values
5- dealing with careless responses
6- drop optional questions 
7- drop irrelevant questions  according to <b><i> PRETEST & VALIDATION PHASE <i/> <b/>
8- Calculate outliers
# STATISTICAL ANALYSIS stage
1- <b>Assessing construct validty :<b/>
     -factor analysis
     - adequacy test
     - multible correspondance analysis
2-<b>Correlation anaysis (Measures of Association): <b/>
     - Cramer's V 
     - Chi-Squared Test
3- <b> Assessing Internal Consistency and Reliability : <b/>
     - Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) for binary  
     - Kuder-Richardson Formula 21 (KR-20) for categorical
